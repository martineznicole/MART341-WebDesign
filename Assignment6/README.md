Adjusting the background color and width helped with my layout. I wanted to pick a color that would stick out but would not be cheesy. I believe I still need to play around with that! The width on the photographs was a little tricky and I believe I accomplished the look I wanted to go for, originally. 

My final design is similar to my initial idea. It has the information I wanted, but I was hoping to make the layout more exciting or jazzy. The basics I did accomplish the look I was going for. 

I did have trouble using CSS and differentiating HTML and CSS. I went back and looked at the instructions and the lesson plan to make sure I was doing things correctly. The biggest thing I had trouble with was adjusting the width. I did not understand how to do that until I looked at your example. I did not find the information in the lesson plan. I am sure I just looked it over. 

I am doing okay! I have emailed to ask you questions if I did not understand anything. Hopefully I am on track and at the level I should be at this point in the class. Seriously, this class has helped me so much with coding, HTML, and GitHub. Thank you!!!
