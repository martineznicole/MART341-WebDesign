Required Techniques (Must Have):

                    3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme. Each page must link to the others flawlessly, utilizing a user-friendly navigation.
                    Framework Integration – Incorporate a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to enhance design and layout.
                        **(Note: you may duplicate one of your existing pages (rename it test.html) to experiment on, and only apply techniques if or once you're happy. Link your test.html page in the nav temporarily. You can also duplicate or create a completely new stylesheet for this page to keep things organized.)**
                    Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal.
                    HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations. Feel free to apply this to your duplicated test page.
                    JavaScript Functionality – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site (test page is totally fine here as well),
